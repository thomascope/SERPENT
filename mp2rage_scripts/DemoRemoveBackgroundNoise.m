% which allows the creation of MP2RAGE T1w images without the strong 
% background noise in air regions. 
%
% although in the original paper the method only worked on raw multichannel
% data, here that contrain has been overcome and the correction can be
% implemented if both SOS images of the two inversion times exist and a
% MP2RAGE T1w image that has been calculated directly from the multichannel
% data as initially proposed in Marques et al, Neuroimage, 2009

% The script will then ask you if you are happy with the image you are 
% getting.
% Ideally it should look like an image that looks like the standard MPRAGE 
% (no noise in the background). If it has too much noise on the background, 
% give it a bigger value.
% 
% If the value is too big you will start noticing that the image gets a 
% bigger bias field -  which will deteriorate the segmentation results.
% Once you are happy with the value you found for one subject you can use 
% the same for all the following subjects by just calling the function like
